# Quarterly Plan Analysis: Dragos Crossover Q4

## Goal 1.1: Establish "Organization Discovery & Alignment" Process

Turn experience from OrgBuilders defining work units and helping education grow into a standard process with high-quality BrainLifts. The document states: "We will turn our experience from the days when OrgBuilders were defining work units and the experience of helping education grow to turn it into a standard process, with high quality brainlifts."

**Identified Expertise Gap:**

OrgBuilders have accumulated tacit knowledge about defining work units, mapping business needs to hiring pipelines, and aligning organizational structure. This knowledge currently exists as tribal knowledge and needs to be formalized. The document explicitly describes challenges: "unclear org structure, work unit plan, pay rates, mapping to industry roles & expertise, orders, DRIs" that led to "duplicate orders, missing orders, over/under hiring, and hiring for the wrong locations."

**Suggested BrainLift: Organization Discovery & Alignment for Hiring**

**Purpose Statement:**
- **Problem:** Education business hiring faces delays and inefficiencies due to unclear organizational structure, undefined work units, misaligned pay rates, ambiguous role mappings, and missing DRIs. These gaps create duplicate orders, missing orders, over/under hiring, and hiring for wrong locations.
- **Expertise Gap:** OrgBuilders have accumulated tacit knowledge about defining work units, mapping roles to industry expertise, structuring organizations, and aligning hiring plans with business needs. This knowledge currently exists as tribal knowledge and needs to be formalized into a repeatable process.
- **In Scope:** Formalizing the process for conducting organization discovery workshops, defining work units, mapping business needs to hiring pipelines, establishing role requirements (min-bar R2s), identifying single Accountable Business Executives per BU/CF, and creating decision frameworks for hiring orders.
- **Out of Scope:** Actual execution of hiring, individual pipeline design, assessment creation, or ongoing operational support beyond initial alignment.

## Goal 1.2-1.5: Other Hiring Operations Improvements

**Detect plagiarism using AI** - Extend fraud detection to proprietary assessments and GDoc-based RWAs.

**Auto-rollout of AI RWA Grading** - Move to AI grading independently after 15-20 submissions.

**Reduce Interview SLAs breach** - Use AI agents to present HMs with relevant information for faster decisions.

**AIPIs** - Expand AIPIs to enable OrgBuilders and HMs to use AI for XO Hire data work.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** These are execution/feature development initiatives, not expertise gaps. The document indicates existing capabilities being extended or automated: "In Q3 we have improved fraud detection" (extending to new areas), "while we have the capability to enable AI grading" (changing rollout process), and "We've rolled out AIPIs" (expanding coverage). No explicit evidence of lacking knowledgethese describe building on existing capabilities.

## Goal 2: Improve Education Hiring

**Sub-initiatives:** Scale Senior OrgBuilders (hire VP OrgBuilder), Outbound Recruiting Engine (contract recruiter + tooling), Org Discovery & Alignment (covered under Goal 1.1), Interviewer Clone Pilot (AI pre-interviews).

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** These are resourcing decisions (hiring people, contracting services), procurement (CRM/VOIP tooling), and product features (AI pre-interviews). No explicit evidence of expertise gaps. The Org Discovery & Alignment component is already covered under Goal 1.1.

**Exception: See Goal 2.1 below**

## Goal 2.1: Standardize Role Filters and Implicit Bars

"Brainlifts: standardize role filters and implicit bars to improve requirement clarity and speed." The document identifies "vague requirements" as one of EDU's top hiring issues and proposes to "standardize...implicit bars."

**Identified Expertise Gap:**

Experienced education hiring managers and interviewers hold tacit knowledge about what truly qualifies candidatesunstated criteria around lived experience, mission alignment, persona fit. The term "implicit bars" directly signals knowledge that needs to be made explicit.

**Suggested BrainLift: Education Role Requirements & Implicit Hiring Bars**

**Purpose Statement:**
- **Problem:** Education hiring suffers from mishires and delays caused by vague requirements. Hiring managers have implicit standards that aren't clearly documented, leading to misalignment between candidates who pass pipelines and what interviewers actually expect.
- **Expertise Gap:** Experienced education hiring managers and interviewers hold tacit knowledge about what truly qualifies candidates for education rolesunstated criteria around lived experience, mission alignment, persona fit, and domain-specific expertise. These implicit bars need to be extracted and formalized into clear, actionable requirements.
- **In Scope:** Documenting implicit hiring criteria for key education roles (2HL, Core Edu, Guides, Reading Specialists), creating standardized role filters, defining minimum bars (R2s) with both explicit qualifications and tacit quality signals, and establishing frameworks for persona-based screening.
- **Out of Scope:** General hiring process design, pipeline infrastructure, assessment creation for non-education roles, or ongoing pipeline operations.

## Goal 3: Align on Relying Primarily on LinkedIn

Secure executive buy-in for multi-year contract with LinkedIn as main sourcing system.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** This is a procurement decision and stakeholder alignment effort, not an expertise gap.

## Goal 4: Scale BrainLift Coach

Increase adoption inside Trilogy to 80% of users finding value in the product by using WorkSmart AI to recommend brainlifts, leveraging user context for weekly recap sessions, and making it valuable for technical roles.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because not enough information.**

**Question:** What business problem does higher BrainLift Coach adoption solve for Trilogy? The goal frames success as "adoption" and "find value" rather than solving a specific problem. What problem do teams currently face that BrainLift Coach addresses? (e.g., Are teams failing to capture critical expertise? Are knowledge gaps causing business failures? Is tribal knowledge creating single points of failure?) Why is the current usage level (35 weekly active users out of 141 registered) insufficientwhat specific outcomes are missing?

## Goal 5: Make WorkSmart Vision AI Valuable

Get 2 core functions using WorkSmart Vision AI to make decisions or generate insights. The document explicitly states: "we do not have clear value proposition that makes customers say 'I need this.'"

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because not enough information.**

**Question:** What specific problems do Central Eng and Central SaaS currently face that WorkSmart Vision AI would solve? The document mentions capabilities ("explain HOW behind WHAT," "augment investigations") but these describe features, not user problems. Why do customers currently choose NOT to activate full behavioral trackingwhat prevents them from seeing value? Without establishing the customer problem, this appears to be solution-first thinking (a product seeking justification).

---

## Goal 6: Make WorkSmart the People Source of Truth

Make XO Manage the source of truth for all contractors working with Trilogy businesses, requiring data cleaning and cross verifications with BUs.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** This is execution/data operations, not an expertise gap. The document describes "data cleaning and cross verifications with the BU" with reliance on "the COO group to support"this is operational work cleaning data and verifying records.

---

## Goal 7: Connect Brand Investment to Business Value

Prove brand impact on hiring metrics and optimize spend for maximum ROI by baselining current impact, targeting problem segments, and optimizing spend.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** This is execution (analytics and optimization), not an expertise gap. The proposed initiatives are standard marketing analytics activities: tracking metrics, targeting segments with poor performance, and optimizing budget allocation. No explicit statement about lacking the expertise to do measurement, targeting, or optimization.
