Hiring Services
Hiring Progress (as of 9/9 EOD)
Q3 Budgeted orders: 198
Unbudgeted orders (30+ days): 89
Unbudgeted orders (<30D old): 41
Canceled budgeted orders: 44
QTD Hires: 179
Completion Rate: 63% (179/284); off track to fill all orders by EOQ due to influx of unbudgeted mid-Q orders
Key points on orders for the Education Business
400K+ roles remain hardest to fill. Numerous MIP:
Hyper-specific Ops spec (MBB alum), leveraging multiple channels to conduct outbound recruitment
Persona-based screening for 2HL & Core Edu roles (personal, lived experience + mission alignment)
Offline executive interviews, often with longer scheduling & feedback timelines
A few roles with compensation / TAM challenges:
Unbound Guide - requires AZ teacher certification, but pays below market total compensation
Bastrop Guide/Reading Specialist roles - TAM <200 people in Bastrop; compensation is 25% lower than roles in Austin (40 mi away)
Across multiple BU/CFs: interview SLAs are causing delays
Ungraded interviews - throttles pipelines, delays hiring
Rescheduled & missed interviews - delays hiring, risks HQ talent loss and reputational damage

Key points on the Software Business
Overall: On track to fill orders (95/122 = 78%)
IgniteTech (Khoros tracker)
IgniteTech is terminating 18% (17/94) of their new Khoros hires (in addition to the 4 offers they’ve already rescinded in Q3). This trend increases the risk of negative employer-brand sentiment on Glassdoor, Reddit, and LinkedIn, which could make it harder for Crossover to attract candidates. IgniteTech ranks 2.7/5.0 on Glassdoor and has a 40% recommend-to-a-friend rating, and their compensation & benefits ratings fell ~23% over the last 12 months. The early terminations and rescinded offers may exacerbate these metrics.
Central Engineering
Order volume: 8-10 topgrades were ordered 4 weeks ago; we’ve filled 2 and have 8 pending offers with 1 backup ready just in case.
Order quality: YTD 45-day retention rate is 92% (34/37)
Improvements: In Q4, we will focus on increasing the interview pass rate (currently ~25%) to save the SVPs some time. In general, we believe 2.9 hours of SVP time (4x 30-min interviews 75% PCCAT pass rate \* 92% retention rate) to produce 1 quality hire is a strong foundation on which to build.
Central Support
Risks to plan: Even though 30-day retention is 64% YTD (up from 39% the previous year) due to improvements we made to the pipeline, this is still considered low. Most terminations are due to the fail fast program, which otherwise qualified agents fail due to “an inability to unblock themselves”.
Improvement proposal: We’ve proposed building a graduation interview-style assessment into the pipeline (that fits within our length parameters), but the support team doesn’t want to do this. We’re going to keep trying to see what we can learn from successful hires.

Hiring Platform & AI Features
We have made progress in making Crossover AI capabilities smarter and powered by BrainLifts.
Candidate Screening Agent: AI connected directly to the R2, interviews candidates, enforces the min bar requirements through thorough screening, cross-referencing the resume, collecting objective evidence as well as context that helps streamline interviews. It also collects information that improves retargeting and thus sourcing efficiency.
Examples: Senior finance role, Engineer, Guide, AI Engineer, Social Platforms Engineer
HM Interview Assistant: prepares executive summaries for each candidate based on the R2 prior to interview, listens through the interview and prepares requirements matching summary and collects hiring managers feedback, feeding it back to OrgBuilders to help improve the pipeline.
Examples: tbd
Pipeline Diagnostics: our goal is to move OrgBuilder work into an agent. This quarter, we’ve exposed the analytics AIPIs that enable OrgBuilders to assess pipeline performance and identify gaps using agents such as Cursor, Windsurf or Ephor by leveraging AIPIs (link)
RWA Grading Agent: (in progress) evolved it from the 1 year old prompt-based design to an agentic flow using current LLMs to enable grading of assessments that previously had low accuracy in AI grading and had to be graded manually.
Test Integrity Agent: switched cheating detection for CodeSignal assessments to AI, relying on the LLM to interpret the various test taking session signals into a cheating decision. With CodeSignal still a central piece for many pipelines, this was a long due capability to enforce test integrity and increase HM trust.
BrainLift Building
Released internally BrainLift Coach (5 minutes demo) - a software based way designed to help construct quality BrainLifts in a scalable way. It includes three parts:
Curriculum: ~30 lessons (including AI-quizz and a test-to-pass) grouped into three levels
100 - Foundations for mastering fundamentals, establish daily practices, and set up tools (Workflowy, Ephor)
200 - Core Development & Application lessons that teach how to transform knowledge into insights and SPOVs, master AI conversations, and leverage social platforms.
300 - Advanced Integration & Mastery lessons to master advanced tools integration (IDEs), validate expertise, and achieve mastery in BrainLift creation.
Feedback: dashboard tracking BrainLift building activity - time, progress and quality
Building:
Live Coach: Workflowy Chrome extension acting as a live coach. Like Grammarly, it proactively follows the users as they work and delivers real-time coaching based on Finders/Fixers analyses
Meeting Insights: listens through meetings and sends a quick email at the end of each call packed with insights, facts, and other data that can be useful to the BrainLifts the user is actively building. It also suggests BrainLifts to build based on the expertise or challenges surfaced during the conversation
Current stats:
141 registered users in the system
383 BrainLifts have been created in 3 months

> 5000 SPOVs have been developed in the ESW community
> 35 weekly active users on average for the Chrome extension
> Over 50 users were interviewed to collect feedback on the product. Feedback is generally positive:
> Positives: clear and topic-relevant coaching, the low-friction (built into Workflowy), integration of learning content, and useful post-meeting reminders that bring up expertise ready to integrate into the BrainLifts
> Concerns: at times overwhelming or unaware of the limitations of scope that user is operating in.
> Brand
> CONTENT CHAMPIONS
> AI content creation capabilities have reached the tipping point where the effort:value ratio of producing a much wider variety of high quality thought leadership content featuring internal SMEs is finally viable.
> We used Q3 contractor survey results to launch “XO Content Champions”, enabling 200 internal SMEs to boost thought leadership platforms, amplify spiky POVs, leverage brainlifts & improve the credibility of XO’s domain-specific content:
> Expert quotes: Why Gamers Excel in AI-Driven Remote Teams, How to Build Connection and Trust in Global Remote Teams
> Guest articles: Why Remote Work Trust Is So Easy to Exploit
> Testimonial stories: Tyisha Brooks, Julia Smolkina (both for Education)
> Launched ‘social pods’ - clusters of XO peers who boost each other’s social media results by offering reciprocal engagement.
> Impact: 4.2x more engagements per impression than Q2.
> THOUGHT LEADERSHIP
> Flagship newsletter Radically Remote delivered a 23.6% YoY increase (+541,223 views) compared with Q3 2024, showing sustained growth year over year. While Q3 views dipped, this mirrors last year’s seasonal trend.
> Importantly, engagement is climbing — the rate improved from 0.86% in Q2 to 1.20% in Q3, boosted by new Content Champion inclusions.
> Radically Remote is still the #11 newsletter on LinkedIn despite not receiving any EasyApply auto-signups for >12 mths, and LI jobs no longer being promoted from XO’s account at all.
> OTHER
> Deployed a new page for WorkSmart, optimized for GenAI search, and improving the brand positioning of WSPro.
> Rebuilt the LLM we use for Glassdoor review responses - it is now achieving the quality bar 75% faster (under 3 mins avg and much stronger messaging).
> Sourcing
> LinkedIn continues to be the main sourcing channel, beating any other channel in volume and quality.
> Google Ads: fine tuned sourcing for engineering talent in terms of geo and targeting and tracking, increasing 3x the number of sign-ups while maintaining the cost per BFQ passer. Details: CW | Quarterly Budget Report | Q3
> This is a change from our Q2 strategy focused on expensive combinations (Education, AI, USA). This combo continues to be best served by LinkedIn.
> SEO: While GenAI search has brought a worldwide dip in traditional search, our AI-first SEO strategy pays off
> Outcomes delivered since Q2:
> AI search traffic up from 12,146 → 17,118 (+41%)
> Average keyword ranking improved from 22.4 → 19.7 (+12%)
> Non-branded search sessions overtook branded search for the first time (now 50.5% of clicks)
> Education page events up +45.2%
> This was partly due to optimizations we deployed to landing page URLs and global footer. More detail in the full report here: Q3 2025 Organic SEO Report & Looker Studio dashboard
> Gauntlet: Deployed email campaigns to top Gauntlet prospects in our candidate pool, generating >50 interview takers
> Apply form time-to-complete has halved from 0:40 to 0:20 since UX redesigning & adding SSO.
> Cost Reduction
> AWS/AI cost was reduced by 25% to $280k/quarter despite increasing usage:
> 3x more WorkSmart AI users
> 10x more users on BrainLift coach
> Increase use of AI in the hiring platform
> Central Support cost did not change:
> We reduced the volume of tickets related to the Crossover Platform from 1500 tickets/week to 650, but the reduction was nullified by an increase in other categories. At this stage, the CS service usage is at expected levels; our strategy will be to rely on CS to reduce cost over time.
> WorkSmart Vision AI
> Aside from powering BrainLift coach capabilities, the WorkSmart AI ontology is now generating internal interest:
> Central Engineering is in the process of enabling leads to leverage WorkSmart AI as part of the coaching practice, answering questions on AI use, work process and process adherence. This is a first natural step towards morphing this into AI-based coaching using the WorkSmart AI ontology Central Engineering brainlifts.
> Central SaaS successfully trialed as an additional source of information in building a trail of per-project activities, supporting both generation of team insights and “recall” for incident management research.

  Key Goals
  Goal 1: Improve Hiring Operations
  Target:
  80% fill rate at the 45 days mark for in-model roles, with LinkedIn sourcing
  100% of pipelines “in-model” (this goal is not full control of Crossover, but measuring it and working to push it higher is the the right thing to do)

Establish the “organization discovery & alignment” process
Why: many of the challenges in education were related to unclear org structure, work unit plan, pay rates, mapping to industry roles & expertise, orders, DRIs. We will turn our experience from the days when OrgBuilders were defining work units and the experience of helping education grow to turn it into a standard process, with high quality brainlifts.
Part of this, we will identify a single Accountable Business Executive for each EDU BU/CF or functional team to approve hiring orders. This will prevent duplicate orders, missing orders, over/under hiring, and hiring for the wrong locations. Ask: requesting that Finance drive this process, as ABEs should be the budget owner/DRI.
Detect plagiarism using AI
Why: ​​Fraud muddles assessment signals and erodes stakeholder confidence in the quality of candidates reaching the interview stage. While PCCAT is a strong defense against hiring fraudsters, these candidates still waste interviewers’ time and increase their skepticism of non-fraudulent candidates. Failing fraudulent candidates pre-interview will save interviewers’ time and reduce their hypervigilance levels during interviews.
How: In Q3 we have improved fraud detection for CodeSignal detection and in Q4 will focus on proprietary AI-assisted coding assessments and the generic GDoc-based RWAs.
Also, we will extend our AI-led screening to connect facts across sessions and detect misrepresentation (candidates who claim to have experience they do not have).
Auto-rolled out of AI RWA Grading to make grading backlogs go away
Why: while we have the capability to enable AI grading for customer RWAs, we have been rolling it up in close alignment with SMEs (establishing rules, calibration, sign-off). While this works well for involved hiring managers, it can still stall the process.
How: We have piloted and are now rolling up an approach where we independently move to AI grading (starting from low-bar to full-grading) after a batch of 15-20 submissions, without being blocked on SME feedback, clearly backlogs and keeping the pipeline functioning.
Reduce Interview SLAs breach Incidence; Streamline HM interview decision using AI agents
Why: delays in interview feedback remain a persistent issue, despite escalation emails.
How:present HMs the right relevant information, leveraging their past interviews to pull up the information of interest and consolidate information across multiple interviewers to make more efficient use of time and enable better hiring decisions.
This, in addition to
GChat with AI - quick prep notes right before the interview or decision reminders soon after
Drop Read.ai - while considered the standard, many users are not willing to connect read.ai to XO due to privacy concerns or cannot do so with their licenses. We’re adding our own bot to eliminate the dependency.
AIPIs
We’ve rolled out AIPIs supporting pipeline troubleshooting that can be used from Ephor, Claude, ChatGPT and AI IDEs and will continue to expand that to allow both OrgBuilders and HMs to use AI to do work that relies on XO Hire data. For OrgBuilders, we will unlock use-cases like Pipeline Improvement, Application review & Interview Planning, stakeholder reporting, etc.
Goal 2: Improve Education Hiring
We will address EDU’s top hiring issues (attention, mishires, vague requirements, and niche roles) with a focused set of initiatives: Edu Hiring Services Plan
Scale Senior OrgBuilders: hire a VP OrgBuilder ($4.2K/wk) and provide weekly decision-clearing sessions plus 24/7 AI status.
Outbound Recruiting Engine: add a contract recruiter ($19.5K–48K for Q4) supported by lead sourcers, plus new CRM/VOIP tooling (RFQs in progress).
Org Discovery & Alignment: structured workshops to clarify work units, roles, pipelines, and min-bar R2s.
Interviewer Clone Pilot: AI-based pre-interviews to reduce low-value live interviews, with a human fallback for senior candidates.
Brainlifts: standardize role filters and implicit bars to improve requirement clarity and speed.
Targets: reduce time-to-offer, cut mishires, raise screen→interview pass quality, and sustain interviews per week (T4W) above plan.
EDU DRI commitment: ~2 hrs/week for context, approvals, and calibration.
Budget impact: est. $125-200K, depending on tooling and contractor
Goal 3: Align on relying primarily on LinkedIn; Stop Searching for Alternatives
Target: secure executive buy-in for a a (multi)yearly contract with LinkedIn LinkedIn Contract Negotiation Approval Request
The 800 LinkedIn job slot extension has expired, taking us down to 200 LinkedIn slots that will be used for Education solely, as initially planned. Consequently, the Q4 hiring capacity will be limited, relying on lower quality, more expensive sources (Google Ads and Indeed) plus our retargeting candidate pool.
As the long term strategy, we are seeking approval to sign a contract with LinkedIn and rely on them as the main sourcing system, acknowledging that alternative channels are low quality, higher cost and leave important talent segments not covered.
For Q4 specifically, we will have to deliver our orders through:
200 LinkedIn slots for education Jobs.
AI retargeting plus alt sourcing channels:
Indeed: works in US, Canada and India with the audience in India being generally low seniority. Candidate quality is 3x worse reflecting in cost per hire despite the cost per applicant being comparable to LinkedIn.
Google Ads: It efficiently sources engineering roles in APAC/Africa, delivering 2-3k applicants per week. Cost metrics are similar to LinkedIn on the same cohort/segment but conversion is lower
Goal 4: Scale BrainLift Coach
Target: increase adoption inside Trilogy - 80% of all Trilogy users spending time on BrainLifts find value in the product.
Beyond its current value add, we plan to make it more useful by
Using WorkSmart AI to recommend brainlifts to create
Leverage the entire user context (WorkSmart AI and meetings) for weekly BrainLift recap sessions
Make it valuable for technical roles that spend a lot of their time with IDE agents and code text
Goal 5: Make WorkSmart Vision AI Valuable
Target: 2 core functions using it to make decisions or generate insights.
The Current Reality
Most customers only use basic time tracking
Full behavioral tracking exists but isn't activated
Our strategy has been making the WorkSmart AI ontology available via AIPIs to anyone interested, but we do not have clear value proposition that makes customers say "I need this"
In Q4, in addition to supporting BrainLift coach use-cases, we will:
Explain the HOW behind the WHAT for any teams turning it up (e.g., how are the top performers working differently)
Focus on important use-cases of two customers:
Central Eng: explain and align use of AI, turn BrainLifts into coaching
Central SaaS: collect product level activity to augment investigations, compare and explore work processes
Support the hiring process by making information available on hires that did or did not work out.
Goal 6: Make WorkSmart the People Source of Truth
Support the COO and SaaS group by making XO Manage the source of truth of all contractors working with Trilogy businesses (SaaS design spec: SaaS Spec - Fixing Central SaaS Security in ESW). Beyond product changes, this will require data cleaning and cross verifications with the BU that we mainly rely on the COO group to support.
Goal 7: Connect Brand investment to business value
Target: Prove brand impact on hiring metrics and optimize spend for maximum ROI
Investment in Brand and Thought Leadership has been constant through the last few years, positioning Crossover as a top destination for AI-first remote jobs. This investment was essential given high performance standards (hire top 1% talent, high performance expectations) that inherently generate negative sentiment. Results are great, to name a few:
Glassdoor: 4.1/5.0 (up from 1.8 in 2021)
Radically Remote newsletter: 2.5M subscribers (#11 newsletter on LinkedIn)
Out of Office vlog: 50M+ views
Andrew is representing us in the Forbes Communications Council
SEO: 50% increase in non-branded search, 41% increase in AI search traffic
Content Champions: 4.2x engagement improvement
Tens of testimonials and hundreds of articles taking our story high in SEO ranks
Starting this quarter, we will pragmatically focus our investment on quantifiable business value. Specifically, we will:
Baseline current impact: Track impact of brand investment on completion rates, acceptance rates, perception
Target problem segments: Focus content on segments with poor metrics (e.g., Education's low fill rates, niche roles)
Optimize spend: Focus our otherwise low investment into areas that best support our hiring goals
The problems that we expect needing most attention are: //tbd
