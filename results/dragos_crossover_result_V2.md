# Quarterly Plan Analysis: Dragos Crossover Q4

## Goal 1: Improve Hiring Operations

### Initiative 1.1: Establish "Organization Discovery & Alignment" Process

**Identified Goal:** Turn experience from defining work units and helping education grow into a standard process with high-quality BrainLifts.

**Analysis:** The document explicitly states the need to "turn our experience...into a standard process" to address challenges around "unclear org structure, work unit plan, pay rates, mapping to industry roles & expertise, orders, DRIs." This is clear evidence of formalizing tacit knowledge (experience from OrgBuilders) into explicit, reusable processes.

**Suggested BrainLift: Organization Discovery & Alignment for Hiring**

**Purpose Statement:**
- **Problem:** Education business hiring faces delays and inefficiencies due to unclear organizational structure, undefined work units, misaligned pay rates, ambiguous role mappings, and missing DRIs. These gaps create duplicate orders, missing orders, over/under hiring, and hiring for wrong locations.
- **Expertise Gap:** OrgBuilders have accumulated tacit knowledge about defining work units, mapping roles to industry expertise, structuring organizations, and aligning hiring plans with business needs. This knowledge currently exists as tribal knowledge and needs to be formalized into a repeatable process.
- **In Scope:** Formalizing the process for conducting organization discovery workshops, defining work units, mapping business needs to hiring pipelines, establishing role requirements (min-bar R2s), identifying single Accountable Business Executives per BU/CF, and creating decision frameworks for hiring orders.
- **Out of Scope:** Actual execution of hiring, individual pipeline design, assessment creation, or ongoing operational support beyond initial alignment.

### Initiative 1.2: Detect Plagiarism Using AI

**Identified Goal:** Extend fraud detection to proprietary AI-assisted coding assessments and generic GDoc-based RWAs, plus detect misrepresentation across sessions.

**Analysis:** The document states "we have improved fraud detection for CodeSignal" and "will focus on" extending to other areas. They describe having the capability and rolling it out more broadly. No explicit evidence of lacking the knowledge to do this.

**Assessment:** This is execution/rollout of existing capabilities, not an expertise gap.

---

### Initiative 1.3: Auto-Rollout of AI RWA Grading

**Identified Goal:** Independently move to AI grading after 15-20 submissions without being blocked on SME feedback.

**Analysis:** Document states "while we have the capability to enable AI grading" and describes the approach as already "piloted." This is about changing the rollout process, not developing new expertise.

**Assessment:** This is execution/process change, not an expertise gap.

---

### Initiative 1.4: Reduce Interview SLAs Breach & Streamline HM Interview Decisions

**Identified Goal:** Use AI agents to present HMs with relevant information to enable faster, better hiring decisions.

**Analysis:** The initiatives described (GChat prep notes, replacing Read.ai with custom bot, consolidating interviewer information) are product features being built. No explicit statement about lacking knowledge to build these.

**Assessment:** This is execution/feature development, not an expertise gap.

---

### Initiative 1.5: AIPIs for Pipeline Troubleshooting

**Identified Goal:** Expand AIPIs to enable OrgBuilders and HMs to use AI for work that relies on XO Hire data.

**Analysis:** Document states they've "rolled out AIPIs" and "will continue to expand." This is feature expansion of existing capability.

**Assessment:** This is execution/feature development, not an expertise gap.

---

## Goal 2: Improve Education Hiring

### Initiative 2.1: Brainlifts for Role Filters and Implicit Bars

**Identified Goal:** Standardize role filters and implicit bars to improve requirement clarity and speed.

**Analysis:** The document explicitly identifies "vague requirements" as one of EDU's top hiring issues and proposes to "standardize...implicit bars." The term "implicit bars" directly signals tacit knowledge that needs to be made explicit.

**Suggested BrainLift: Education Role Requirements & Implicit Hiring Bars**

**Purpose Statement:**
- **Problem:** Education hiring suffers from mishires and delays caused by vague requirements. Hiring managers have implicit standards (bars) that aren't clearly documented, leading to misalignment between candidates who pass pipelines and what interviewers actually expect.
- **Expertise Gap:** Experienced education hiring managers and interviewers hold tacit knowledge about what truly qualifies candidates for education rolesunstated criteria around lived experience, mission alignment, persona fit, and domain-specific expertise. These implicit bars need to be extracted and formalized into clear, actionable requirements.
- **In Scope:** Documenting implicit hiring criteria for key education roles (2HL, Core Edu, Guides, Reading Specialists), creating standardized role filters, defining minimum bars (R2s) with both explicit qualifications and tacit quality signals, and establishing frameworks for persona-based screening.
- **Out of Scope:** General hiring process design, pipeline infrastructure, assessment creation for non-education roles, or ongoing pipeline operations.

---

### Initiative 2.2: Other Education Hiring Improvements

**Identified Initiatives:**
- Scale Senior OrgBuilders (hire VP OrgBuilder)
- Outbound Recruiting Engine (contract recruiter + tooling)
- Org Discovery & Alignment (covered under Goal 1.1)
- Interviewer Clone Pilot (AI-based pre-interviews)

**Analysis:** These are resourcing decisions (hiring people, contracting services), procurement (CRM/VOIP tooling), and product features (AI pre-interviews). No explicit evidence of expertise gaps.

**Assessment:** These are execution/resourcing decisions, not expertise gaps.

---

## Goal 3: Align on Relying Primarily on LinkedIn

**Identified Goal:** Secure executive buy-in for multi-year contract with LinkedIn as main sourcing system.

**Analysis:** This is a procurement decision and stakeholder alignment effort.

**Assessment:** This is procurement/business decision, not an expertise gap.

---

## Goal 4: Scale BrainLift Coach

**Identified Goal:** Increase adoption inside Trilogy to 80% of users finding value in the product.

**Critical Question:** What problem does higher BrainLift Coach adoption solve for Trilogy?

The document describes BrainLift Coach as a tool to "help construct quality BrainLifts in a scalable way" with positive feedback from 50+ users. However, the goal frames success as "adoption" and "find value" rather than solving a specific business problem.

**Questions to Clarify:**
1. What business problem does Trilogy face that higher BrainLift Coach adoption would solve? (e.g., Are teams failing to capture critical expertise? Are knowledge gaps causing business failures? Is tribal knowledge creating single points of failure?)
2. Why is the current 35 weekly active users (out of 141 registered) insufficient? What specific outcomes are missing at current adoption levels?

**Analysis:** The proposed improvements (WorkSmart AI recommendations, weekly recaps, IDE integration) are product features. This appears to be solution-first thinkinga product seeking justification for broader adoption.

**Assessment:** Need to clarify the underlying problem before proposing BrainLifts. Current framing suggests execution (product improvement), but the goal itself requires validation.

---

## Goal 5: Make WorkSmart Vision AI Valuable

**Identified Goal:** Get 2 core functions using WorkSmart Vision AI to make decisions or generate insights.

**Critical Problem:** The document explicitly states: "we do not have clear value proposition that makes customers say 'I need this.'"

This is a red flag for solution-first thinking. They have behavioral tracking capabilities and AI ontology, but customers only use basic time tracking.

**Questions to Clarify:**
1. What specific problems do Central Eng and Central SaaS currently face that WorkSmart Vision AI would solve? (The document mentions "explain HOW behind WHAT" and "augment investigations," but these are capabilities, not problems)
2. Why do customers currently choose NOT to activate full behavioral tracking? What prevents them from seeing value?
3. For the stated use cases:
   - Central Eng: What decision-making or alignment problem exists that AI ontology would solve?
   - Central SaaS: What investigation or process comparison need exists that current tools don't address?

**Analysis:** This appears to be a product seeking a problem. The goal is framed as "make it valuable" rather than "solve X problem using this capability."

**Assessment:** Solution-first red flag. Need to establish what customer problems exist before proposing BrainLifts or proceeding with this goal.

---

## Goal 6: Make WorkSmart the People Source of Truth

**Identified Goal:** Make XO Manage the source of truth for all contractors working with Trilogy businesses.

**Analysis:** The document describes this as requiring "data cleaning and cross verifications with the BU" with reliance on "the COO group to support." This is operational workcleaning data, verifying records, coordinating with business units.

**Assessment:** This is execution/data operations, not an expertise gap.

---

## Goal 7: Connect Brand Investment to Business Value

**Identified Goal:** Prove brand impact on hiring metrics and optimize spend for maximum ROI.

**Analysis:** The proposed initiatives are:
- Baseline current impact (track metrics)
- Target problem segments (focus content on segments with poor metrics)
- Optimize spend (focus investment on areas supporting hiring goals)

These are standard marketing analytics and optimization activities. No explicit statement about lacking the expertise to do measurement, targeting, or optimization.

**Question to Consider:** While not an expertise gap, there's an interesting challenge here: how to attribute brand impact to hiring outcomes when many variables affect hiring success. However, the document doesn't indicate they lack the capability to do this analysisthey're simply committing to do it.

**Assessment:** This is execution (analytics and optimization), not an expertise gap.
