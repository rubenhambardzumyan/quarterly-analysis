Executive Summary

Executive Summary
Prior Quarter Review
Current Quarter Plan
Annual Plan
CF Plan
🔴 Missed critical leadership hires, leading to strategic volatility and rework despite the raw throughout (>11.9k SUs).
🔴 Personnel instability from resignations and medical leave created friction and single points of failure.
🔴 The resulting volatility blocked key operational goals.
✅ Successfully rebalanced teams into smaller pods, boosting raw output, and revamped the Brainlift workflow, generating over 80 individual BLs.

- Stabilize: Implement a dual-stream strategy to protect long-term initiatives (Incept, SIS) from short-term product volatility, while enforcing mandatory written requirements for new features.
- Lead: Aggressively pursue a diversified hiring strategy to fill critical product leadership gaps (SVP/VP/PO) and mitigate engineering single points of failure.
- Execute: Dedicate protected time to clear the backlog of operational goals from Q3 (Jira migration, reusable chat pattern, AI-led code reviews).
- Expand engineering beyond traditional boundaries to own outcomes and fill product/design gaps.
- Build a catalog of reusable AI-first patterns using popular, IDE-native tech.
- Double down on cyborg-first workflows centered in the IDE, powered by MCP-backed AI-PI.
  Finance Performance & Forecasts
  WS.Eng posted an unplanned profit of ~$100k.
  This was not a result of over-performance, but a negative signal driven by a 10% reduction in headcount costs from unplanned attrition and missed hiring targets.
  While SU delivery targets were met, this short-term financial gain masks the long-term cost of instability and rework.
  WS.Eng plans to break even.
  The key drivers of this plan are:
  Dedicating capacity to strategic initiatives to build long-term value.
  Stabilizing new development via mandatory written requirements to reduce churn.
  Filling critical leadership roles to ensure strategic alignment and efficient use of resources.
  WS.Eng plans to break even.

Prior Quarter Review (Q3 2025)
Strategic Priorities
🔴 Missed: Launch an AI-native product leadership role.
Our primary goal for the quarter was to hire senior product and design leadership to provide strategic direction.
This search was unsuccessful, creating a leadership vacuum that blocked progress on multiple fronts and led to downstream volatility in the product roadmap.
🔴 Missed: Redesign the design function to match our delivery model.
This initiative was dependent on hiring a new design leader.
Without a clear owner for this function, no progress was made. The existing design process remains a point of friction for our iterative, AI-first workflow.

Financial Performance
🟢 Met: Increase delivery capacity to >11,000 SUs.
Despite significant personnel instability, the team exceeded its throughput target, delivering 11,966 story units.
Operational improvements, particularly the rebalancing of teams into smaller pods, were effective at increasing output per engineer.
However, this achievement was tempered by significant unplanned capacity constraints.
🔴 Missed: Maintain headcount stability and continuity.
The quarter was severely impacted by personnel churn. We experienced:
2 unplanned resignations from valuable, high-performing engineers.
3 team members on extended, unexpected medical leave.
External factors impacting availability (e.g., military draft).
This instability created single points of failure, disrupted team continuity, and constrained our overall capacity.

Operational Performance
🔴 Missed: Cut time-to-market by aggressively pushing back against scope creep.
The lack of a stable product roadmap and clear leadership made it impossible to achieve this goal.
Engineering teams were subjected to constantly shifting targets and volatile strategies, which led to significant rework and neutralized efficiency gains.
🔴 Missed: Define a new reusable pattern for LLM-based chat interfaces.
Similar to the time-to-market goal, this was blocked by the absence of a stable product direction.
Without a clear, long-term use case to build against, defining a durable, reusable pattern was not feasible.
🟡 Partial: Evaluate and replace Jira with a simpler, AI-first alternative.
The evaluation was completed, and a decision was made to migrate all initiatives to GitHub Issues.
The migration process began but was not fully completed by the end of the quarter due to shifting priorities and resource constraints. Finalizing this transition is a key goal for Q4.
🟢 Met: Revamp Brainlift workflow to promote individual ownership.
We successfully shifted to a bottom-up model where engineers write individual, topic-based Brainlifts.
This led to a surge in adoption, with over 80 new Brainlifts created during the quarter.
Of these, 10 high-quality guides were identified and consolidated for shared team use, covering topics like Chrome Extension Development, Effective Note Taking, Principles of Production Database Design & Operation, Unit Testing, and Typescript Engineering Doctrines.

Insights & Key Learnings
High throughput is meaningless without a stable strategy.
While we successfully increased our raw output (SUs), much of that effort was neutralized by churn and rework.
The constantly changing product direction meant that work was often discarded or significantly altered.
Many of our teams have been primarily deleting or significantly rebuilding features that they shipped one or two quarters ago.
Our primary bottleneck is not engineering execution, but the absence of a clear and stable product vision.
Personnel instability has become our most significant operational risk.
The unplanned attrition and extended leaves this quarter exposed significant vulnerabilities.
Key knowledge is concentrated in a few individuals, and we lack the redundancy to handle unexpected departures.
This created single points of failure (e.g., Rezgar, Denys) that directly impacted our ability to execute on strategic initiatives.
When faced with numerous fires, we lacked the discipline to focus on operational improvements.
Continuous improvement efforts were almost entirely sacrificed in favor of reactive firefighting this quarter.
The constant churn and volatility consumed all available bandwidth, preventing us from focusing on our own operational enhancements.
The few improvements that were implemented (e.g., team rebalancing, BrainLift workflow adjustments) yielded positive results.
Still, we were unable to dedicate the focused time needed to address the backlog of key operational goals.
Annual Plan
Expand the Engineering role beyond traditional boundaries across Product & Design.
We hit the limit of productivity gains within traditional engineering scopes.
To grow further, engineers need to own more of the product process. That includes shaping outcomes, making design calls, and filling gaps previously handled by PMs, TPMs, or Designers.
This is already in motion through Epic-based work units and Product Engineer hiring.
Build a catalog of reusable AI patterns using ubiquitous, AI-first tech.
We’ll focus on patterns built on broadly used, IDE-native tech like React and CDK.
These enable fast, AI-powered workflows and are easier to adopt across teams.
The first pattern (real-time activity detection) is live. Others will follow, building momentum and standardization.
Drive a cyborg-first AI adoption approach with the IDE at the center.
We’re focused on workflows where engineers and AI work together inside the IDE.
Tools like Cursor show that Centaur-style automation thrives in this context.
The key unlock is the MCP-backed AI-PI, which gives AI the context it needs to plan, write, and review code. Our goal is to wire more of our ecosystem into this hub.
Current Quarter Plan (Q4 2025)
Strategic Priorities
Stabilize product development with a dual-stream strategy.
To counteract the volatility that defined Q3, we will structure all engineering work into two parallel streams. This will insulate a significant portion of the team from short-term product churn and allow for stable, long-term progress on foundational assets.
Product Feature Stream: Focused on new user-facing capabilities, this stream will be governed by a mandatory written requirements process. No major feature work will begin without being written down: requirements, problem statement, and background context.
Strategic Initiatives Stream: An engineering-led program with a stable, pre-approved roadmap focused on modernizing platforms and reducing operational drag. Q4 initiatives include: Incept, AI-First Admissions, replace/rebuild the SIS, and the CoachBot Sunset.

Resolve the Product Leadership Gap.
Filling this gap is our single most important prerequisite for long-term success. This will be a primary focus in Q4.
We will diversify our hiring pipelines to find the right combination of strategic and tactical leadership:
SVP / Chief Product Officer ($200/hr) - part of the LwAI Budget.
VP / Lead Product Owner ($100/hr)
Product Owners ($50/hr)

Stretch goal: revamp the UI/UX design function.
We will replace the current designer with a $100/h role that better fits our iterative, AI-first workflow.
Design will be split into two main work activities:
Proactive guardrails: Help Product identify only the critical UX constraints early.
Reactive reviews: Evaluate shipped UIs and give feedback for next iterations.

Operational Goals
Re-commit to continuous operational improvement.
In Q3, proactive improvements were sacrificed for reactive firefighting. In Q4, this becomes a formal priority with time dedicated to refining our internal workflows, tools, and processes.
Success criteria: Clear the backlog of key operational goals from prior quarters:
Publish the reusable LLM-based chat pattern.
Finalize the full migration of all projects from Jira to GitHub Issues.
Finalize the transition to AI-led code reviews for all PRs.
Mitigate single points of failure in key engineering roles.
The instability in Q3 highlighted significant risks from knowledge concentration.
To address this, we will: Hire a Lead Engineer ($100/hr) with a focus on building platforms to reduce dependency on key individuals.
Financial Performance
Maintain stable delivery while focusing on the foundations of our products. Target ~11,000 SUs (same target as Q3).
Our Q4 delivery target is ~11,000 Story Units, matching our Q3 goals.
This target reflects a deliberate strategic shift to dedicate capacity to the Strategic Initiatives stream.
This investment in our foundation is critical for long-term velocity and stability.
Fill critical leadership and engineering gaps.
Our hiring budget for Q4 is focused on resolving the core issues identified in Q3.
Success Criteria:
Successfully hire at least one S/VP Product Lead and one Product Owner to fill the critical leadership gap.
Successfully hire a $100/h lead engineer.
