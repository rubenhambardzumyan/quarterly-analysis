**==(BrainLift) Central Engineering Strategy==**

- ==Owner==
  - Jozsef Czapovics, Head of Central Engineering
- ==Purpose==
  - This BrainLift offers a roadmap for how AI can transform our takeover strategy—not as a side project, but as the core method for achieving our acquisition objectives.
  - Our Central Engineering goal is clear: acquire and fully take over a software company—especially one with a messy legacy codebase—at record-low cost and record-low risk. Historically, this has been our ambition. Now, AI is reshaping the world and our strategy. In this BrainLift, I’ll define the AI-first path that helps us stabilize and modernize these acquisitions faster and more effectively than ever.
  - In-Scope:
    - Acquiring software companies with legacy codebases and technical debt
    - Using AI-driven engineering processes to quickly stabilize, test, and modernize these codebases
    - Focusing on cost reduction, risk mitigation, and time-to-stability improvements through AI
  - Out-of-Scope:
    - Greenfield product development (building brand-new systems from scratch)
    - Generic or “random” AI explorations that don’t directly accelerate or de-risk the acquisition and modernization of legacy software systems
- ==DOK4 - SPOV==
  - ==DOK4 SPOV - The 100x Dev is Here==
    - With AI-first tools, one developer can now manage what used to take a full team. Testing, documentation, and debugging are handled by agents inside the IDE. The 100x dev isn’t a myth. It’s our new normal.
      - Implementation: Engineers use AI-augmented IDEs to write, test, document, and ship code autonomously. They own entire subsystems—2 to 3 per person—with all supporting work (QA, docs, infra) handled inline by agents or automation. Developers will shift from writing code to guiding teams of agents—providing high-level direction and maintaining expert-level standards and constraints. These agents will be capable of producing full PRs, running tests, and proposing refactors, with the engineer in a supervisory role. Over time, these AI systems—plus our internal rule sets and quality constraints—will be usable by product experts directly. Instead of waiting for engineering capacity, they’ll define functionality and iterate independently. Engineering becomes a high-quality, trusted service platform focused on performance, architecture, and resilience.
      - This isn't just theory—we're seeing real-world cost reductions where AI-augmented workflows cut costs by 6-7x in production environments.

  - ==DOK4 SPOV - Headcount is History==
    - We buy companies with hundreds of engineers and stabilize them with a small AI-augmented team—fewer than 10% of the original headcount. We don’t just modernize code—we reinvent the economics of software acquisitions.
      - Implementation: We analyze coordination-heavy structures during due diligence using org chart, code contributions, tenure, and interview data (processed via Ephor). Within one week post-close, we finalize role mappings into our super-flat model. We don’t retain managers, middle layers, or duplicative specialists. Instead, we replace coordination with DRIs and all ahnds on contribution with AI-first engineers who own testing, infra, docs, and delivery directly. We categorize staff into D1, D30, and D90 exits. Day 1 roles are non-critical and exit immediately. Day 30 roles require minimal transition. Day 90 roles are critical—these go through structured AI knowledge capture and can apply to stay via our standard process. Short-term QA is retained to support test automation bootstrapping and early release stability.
      - Use Case example
        - In the Khoros acquisition, we evaluated 144 team members across engineering, QA, product, and infra. Using org charts, code contributions, salary, tenure, and structured interviews (via Ephor), we mapped every role for exit at Day 0, Day 30, or Day 90.
        - We rebuilt the org with a 30-person Central Engineering team:
          - No retained management or middle layers
          - DRIs running testing, infra, documentation, and delivery via AI
          - Full system takeover + launch of a new AI-first product vision
          - Sub-$2M/year cost structure
        - This is the model: Exit everyone. Compress the org. Deliver more with 1/6 the people and 1/6 the cost.
        - Exit drivers included:
          - Coordination-heavy PM and QA roles replaced by AI
          - Specialists with unclear ownership or no code footprint
          - Strong individuals who didn’t fit our super-flat structure
        - $11.6M USD in annual salary was removed
        - 100% of the original team was exited by Day 90

  - ==DOK4 SPOV - Reset to Win==
    - We replace legacy teams quickly—starting with management on day one, and the rest within 30 - 90 days. AI agents help us extract SME knowledge, generate LLM first documentation, and onboard new teams without long handovers.
      - Implementation: Use LLM-based knowledge transfer: generate structured session lists with AI, record asynchronous SME sessions, run automated QC, and store all outputs centrally. This ensures Central can operate the product without legacy dependencies.
      - Impact: Ramp time drops from 3 months to 3 weeks. Team size shrinks by 90% without losing key system knowledge.

  - ==DOK4 SPOV - Code Arbitrage==
    - We don’t avoid bad code—we target it. Legacy systems with high technical debt are often mispriced and misunderstood. We stabilize and modernize them faster than traditional teams can assess them. Arbitrage is about execution: we fix what others won’t touch.
      - Implementaiton: Use AI to extract business logic, seams, and dependencies within the first 30 days. Generate tests, scaffold documentation, and identify modernization paths. Complete targeted refactors and stabilization within 90 days.
      - To do this, we use our AI-first knowledge extraction system:
        - Topics are auto-generated from code and documentation using our internal AI framework.
        - Engineers record structured walkthroughs per topic, supported by shared documents.
        - Recordings and assets are processed into structured context packs using ProductMind, then linked directly to the codebase.
        - These packs are searchable and queryable via Ephor, our in-house AI knowledge interface.
        - This makes the entire system navigable by devs or agents—so handoffs, modernization, and risk assessment can be done without legacy team reliance.
        - Real world example: Our AI gateway approach allows us to analyze patterns in real-time, identify inefficiencies (like redundant API calls or parsing errors), and implement fixes that dramatically reduce operational costs while improving system stability.

  - ==DOK4 SPOV – Growth or Go==
    - Most companies try to coach everyone. We don’t. Coaching is a limited resource—and we allocate it where it compounds. You’re either on a growth trajectory, or you’re exiting. That’s the deal.
      - Implementation: We assess every engineer quarterly, relative to their current role and salary band. There are only three outcomes:
        - Behind: Not meeting expectations. Coaching: 20%
        - On Track: Meeting expectations. Coaching: baseline
        - Growth: Exceeding expectations. Coaching: 80%
      - Managers coach for return, not recovery. Exit decisions are structured and expected. Promotions are planned. We don’t retain low performers indefinitely. And we don’t build systems that depend on them.

    - An AI-native developer now operates as a platform—using agents for testing, infra, and docs. Implementation: Replace team-based roles (QA, doc, ops) with a Dev+Agents setup. Measure throughput in verticals (1 dev, 3 systems). Competitors still assume engineering means “collaboration + coordination.” Their operating assumption is **“teams build software.” **Execution is no longer a team—it’s a **stack inside the IDE**.

    - While most engineering teams chase new projects, we’ve built a playbook for turning around neglected, messy codebases. That niche expertise—fast takeovers of crumbling software—gives us leverage in the acquisition market. We see value where others see problems, because we know exactly how to fix those problems quickly and reliably.

  - DOK3: Workforce Reset = Value Play
    - Core Idea: Buyers don’t try to blend teams—they swap them out. More than half the staff (especially managers) is replaced within two years, mostly with younger, cheaper hires. Cutting payroll and reshaping culture is treated as a core value lever, not a side effect.

  - DOK3: The “Keep Key People” Myth
    - Core Idea: Integration playbooks preach retaining talent for knowledge transfer, but the numbers say otherwise—only 9 % of roles move through internal transfers, while ~ 67 % go to outsiders. Buyers find it faster (and cheaper) to rebuild know-how from scratch than to coax it from legacy staff.
    - Implementation: We actively track legacy team engagement during the transition period. When key people become disengaged despite being on 90-day retention plans, we don't hesitate to accelerate their exit if legally feasible. This approach prevents wasting resources on staff who aren't contributing to knowledge transfer and reinforces our commitment to building new institutional knowledge rather than preserving old patterns.

  - DOK3 Insight: Coordination Collapse → Acquisition Advantage
    - Most acquirers fear legacy because of handoffs, coordination, and knowledge risk. We treat that as a discount. AI replaces those friction points with agents. Implementation: Map coordination hotspots (QA loops, release approvals, SME signoffs). If they’re automatable, reduce deal price by 15–20% and absorb execution risk internally. Coordination is no longer a cost center—it’s an arbitrage lever. Competitors still think legacy complexity means you need more people. We know it just needs fewer dependencies.

    - Legacy code isn’t a place for memory—it’s a place for clarity. AI-fluent juniors with zero context outperform legacy seniors with scar tissue. Implementation: Prioritize fresh hires for takeover pods. Use AI onboarding agents to teach systems in 14 days. Retire the assumption that experience equals effectiveness. Competitors fight to “retain key people.” We replace them with clean slates—and better outcomes.
      - Real-world application: In the Khoros acquisition, we observed that legacy team members like Slava became increasingly disengaged during transition, while our fresh engineering teams integrated quickly by leveraging AI tools to understand the codebase. Rather than forcing collaboration with disengaged legacy staff, we accelerated our independence by having new team members directly tackle bug fixes and system issues, which simultaneously built their system knowledge and demonstrated our AI-first approach's effectiveness.

    - Core Idea: During acquisition transitions, every interaction with legacy staff must be treated as a deliberate knowledge extraction opportunity, not just casual collaboration. We track these interactions as "knowledge dependencies" and measure our progress toward independence by how quickly they decrease
    - Implementation: Teams maintain a "knowledge dependency tracker" that logs every question asked of legacy staff, categorizing them as either "critical" (preventing outages/major issues) or "convenience" (could be solved independently with more effort). This creates accountability for reducing dependencies before the transition period ends.

    - Erik Dietrich (DaedTech)
      - Erik Dietrich is a consultant, author, and blogger focused on legacy code modernization and engineering leadership.
      - Main Views: Never assume you can “just fix a bug” in legacy code without consequences: Even small changes can unleash a flood of hidden defects, so the industry’s casual approach to “quick fixes” is dangerously naïve. Legacy code is a cultural artifact, not just a technical mess: Understanding why code is the way it is—seeing it as “anthropology”—is more important than rushing to refactor or replace it.
      - Why Follow: Dietrich’s perspective challenges the dominant “just patch it” or “rewrite it” mindsets, urging leaders to approach legacy takeovers with humility and a deep respect for the code’s history.

      - This group of researchers publishes empirical studies on the realities of bug introduction and bugfixing in large software systems.
      - Main Views: “The code you fix is rarely where the bug was introduced”—their research shows that only a minority of bug fixes actually correspond to the lines of code that introduced the bug. They argue that the industry’s reliance on tools and processes that assume a direct link between bug-inducing and bug-fixing commits is fundamentally flawed, advocating for a broader, system-level approach to bug analysis and fix strategies.
      - Why Follow: Their work challenges the foundations of much automated bug tracking and root cause analysis, urging teams to rethink how they trace and fix defects.

    - Adam Tornhill
      - Adam Tornhill is a software engineer, author of Your Code as a Crime Scene, and creator of CodeScene.
      - Main Views: Tornhill argues that most RCA in software is ineffective because it ignores code history and developer behavior. He advocates for forensic analysis—using version control data, code churn, and hotspot analysis—to trace recurring bugs to their true origins, often finding that social factors (like team turnover) are just as important as technical ones. This challenges the industry’s focus on static code analysis and immediate code fixes.
      - Why Follow: Tornhill’s work brings a data-driven, behavioral science approach to RCA, pushing teams to look beyond the codebase and into how code is actually changed and maintained over time.

  - **Release Quality with legacy systems**
    - Vipin Jain
      - Vipin Jain is a QA Head, Project Delivery Manager at Metacube, and a frequent international conference speaker and writer on legacy testing practices.
      - Main Views: Jain argues that for legacy systems, manual QA is irreplaceable for release quality because automation is often impractical or impossible due to missing documentation, outdated tech stacks, and tightly coupled code. He insists that every bug fix in a legacy codebase should come with a new test—manual if automation isn’t feasible. Jain also emphasizes the need for testers to become “detectives,” using exploratory and end-to-end manual tests to uncover hidden issues that automation would miss.
      - Why Follow: Jain’s hands-on, pragmatic approach is widely respected in the QA community, especially for teams dealing with high-stakes, high-risk legacy releases.

    - Valentina Jemuović (Optivem Journal)
      - Valentina is the author of the Optivem Journal and a consultant for engineering leaders and senior developers working with legacy code.
      - Main Views: She asserts that in legacy projects, manual end-to-end (E2E) testing is essential before release, as it’s often the only way to validate real user flows when automation coverage is low or non-existent. Valentina is skeptical of jumping straight to acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) in legacy systems, advocating instead for a gradual transition—starting with robust manual E2E tests, then automating over time.
      - Why Follow: Valentina’s stepwise, manual-first approach is a counterpoint to the “automate everything” movement and is grounded in real-world legacy project constraints.
