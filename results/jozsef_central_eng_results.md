# Quarterly Plan Analysis: Jozsef Central Engineering Q4

## Goal 1: Achieve 100% Kanban Goal Delivery Through AI Check-Ins

Build an AI-based check-in system that analyzes progress trends and recommends adjustments in scope, sequencing, or resourcing to move from 90% to 100% delivery.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is execution/tooling development, not an expertise gap. The document describes building AI automation to replace "inaccurate" manual measurement with "significant lag." No explicit evidence that the team lacks knowledge about how to assess progress or make adjustmentsthe problem is the inefficiency of manual processes, which automation addresses. The goal describes what to build (AI check-in system) rather than what knowledge to formalize.

## Goal 2: Eliminate Khoros Maintenance Backlog

Use the agentic platform to triage and resolve 400+ legacy maintenance tickets in Khoros, achieving average ticket age under 7 days.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is execution, not an expertise gap. The goal describes deploying existing AI capabilities (agentic platform, Taro maintenance agent, AI-KB, IDE workflows) to clear a backlog. No explicit statement about lacking the knowledge or capability to triage/resolve ticketsthey have the tools and are applying them to eliminate legacy work.

## Goal 3: Standardize AI IDE Workflows Across Engineering

Replace fragmented engineering practices (100 engineers = 100 workflows) by rolling out a unified, AI-first IDE workflow with 80% compliance target. The document states: "We leverage our AI experience from the last 3 years to roll out standard workflow and promptsensuring even our newest staff benefit from our AI capability."

**Question:**

Is this about formalizing tacit knowledge from experienced engineers, or documenting already-understood best practices?

The phrase "leverage our AI experience from the last 3 years" suggests accumulated knowledge exists. Does creating "standard workflow and prompts" require extracting implicit expertise from experienced engineers (tacit ’ explicit knowledge formalization), or is this simply writing down practices that are already well-understood but not yet documented?

**Why this matters:** If experienced engineers have undocumented practices developed over 3 years that newer staff can't accessand standardization requires capturing this implicit knowledgethen this would be an expertise gap worth a BrainLift. If the workflows are already known and just need to be written down, this is execution.

## Goal 4: Maintain Budget Discipline on People Cost

Stay within approved Q4 HC budget of $2.98M by enforcing tighter topgrading and disciplined hiring, requiring written plans for all hires.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is execution/process discipline, not an expertise gap. Q3 overspent by ~$250K due to "topgrading overlap" and "late-stage hiring momentum not tied to active plans." The goal describes enforcing existing controls (written justification, monthly tracking, zero off-plan additions). No indication the team lacks knowledge about budget managementthe issue is adherence to known processes.

---

## Goal 5: Increase Autonomous AI Code Contribution to 25%

Scale adoption of the Claude Code + Docker-based autonomous agent platform to reach 25% of total code output, with each engineer defining at least 3 agents.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is execution/adoption, not an expertise gap. The document explicitly states "Platform is already deployed; success depends on team compliance with agent definition." The "Most Important Problems" section confirms: "We've laid the groundwork for autonomous agents, but engineering output still relies heavily on only AI supported workflows." No explicit evidence of lacking knowledge to create agentsthe issue is scaling usage through compliance and getting engineers to define agent flows.

---

## Goal 6: Restore Gross Margin to 95%+

Reduce CF COGS from $233K to d$133K ($100K) by repricing and rationalizing CF services, shifting non-prod compute to lower-cost tiers.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is execution (repricing, rationalization, infrastructure optimization), not an expertise gap. The goal describes specific cost-cutting actions with no indication of lacking the knowledge to execute them.

---

## Goal 7: Achieve Q4 Net Margin 8%+

Improve overall profitability to deliver Net Margin of 8%+ by combining e$100K CF COGS reduction with HC spend adherence and incremental revenue lift.

**Why no BrainLift:** This is a financial target achieved through execution of other goals (Goals 4 and 6), not an expertise gap. No knowledge formalization requiredthis is about executing known cost and revenue strategies.
