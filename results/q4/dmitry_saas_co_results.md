# Quarterly Plan Analysis: Dmitry SaaS VP of CO Q4

## Goal 1: Execute $3.1M PA CR for Khoros

Deliver $3.1M per annum cost reduction via 3 kanbans ($1M each), planned by David S., with zero CO-related production outages and SLA adherence on CO tickets.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** This is execution of a pre-defined plan, not an expertise gap. The document states the plan is "planned by David S." with clear kanban allocation and success metrics. No explicit evidence of lacking knowledge or capability to execute.

## Goal 2: Execute $500k PA CR for Rest of ESW

Deliver $500k per annum cost reduction for ESW portfolio using 1 kanban slot, seeded with "high-quality hypotheses actionable within the quarter."

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because not enough information.**

**Question:** What expertise or decision framework is needed to turn budget variance data (ranging from 22% to 185% deviations) into "high-quality hypotheses actionable within the quarter"? Is this judgment based on tacit experience that needs to be formalized, or is it straightforward financial analysis?

## Goal 3: Build AI-Driven Cost Anomaly Analysis Process

Create an automated pipeline that receives AWS Cost Anomaly alerts, enriches them with data, generates reports to account owners, and excludes "known noise" from reporting.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because no need to suggest.**

**Why:** This is execution/automation of known patterns, not an expertise gap. The supporting data (DOK1/2) provides detailed documentation of noise patterns (S3 tier transitions, CloudWatch metric tiers, EBS pricing variations, weekly vs daily comparisons), demonstrating they already possess the knowledge needed to classify anomalies. The goal is to automate the application of this existing knowledge.

## Goal 4: Build AI Runbooks for Health Checks After CO Changes

Create automated runbooks covering at least 60% of CO tickets, with automated metadata collection and runbook output published as GitHub comments.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because not enough information.**

**Question:** What determines when an automated runbook is "good enough" to validate a CO change vs when human verification is required? Why is 60% the coverage targetwhat characterizes the 40% that won't be automated?

---

## Goal 5: Streamline Cost Reporting

Create a spec that documents decisions around amortization and cost tracking, then implement a script that automatically produces weekly budget reports.

**Couldn't suggest a BrainLift because not enough information.**

**Question:** Are the amortization rules and anomaly thresholds described in the supporting data (DOK1/2) existing practices that need to be documented, or are they expertise that needs to be developed and formalized? The detailed documentation of time-based amortization, account-based amortization, and cost anomaly thresholds could represent either established practices requiring documentation (execution) or tacit knowledge requiring formalization (expertise gap). Which is it?
